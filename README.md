React Vite App with TypeScript
About the App
This application harnesses the power of React coupled with the efficiency of Vite, optimized with TypeScript for a robust front-end development experience. We've integrated essential plugins and tools to boost productivity and performance.


Here's a revised section of the README.md:

Key Technologies
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A modern frontend build tool that significantly improves the development experience.
TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability.
Zustand: A minimalistic state management solution.
Vitest: A Vite-native unit test framework that is performant and feature-rich.
ESLint: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
Prettier: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.

Components
The app is structured with modular components like Header, TodoForm, TodoInfo, TodoControls, TodoList, and a CounterCard, each serving a distinct function and demonstrating React's composability.

Running the App
Clone the repository.
Run npm install to install the dependencies.
Use npm run dev to start the development server.
For production builds, testing, and linting, refer to the scripts section in the package.json.

Running Tests
To ensure our codebase maintains high quality, we've included a comprehensive suite of tests. Run the test suite using the following commands:

npm run test: Executes the test suite once.
npm run test:watch: Runs the test suite in watch mode for development.
npm run test:ui: Opens the Vitest UI to interactively run and debug tests.
npm run test:coverage: Generates a coverage report to ensure all parts of your code are tested.
Our tests cover unit tests for components, utilities, and state management to ensure everything functions correctly before deployment.
